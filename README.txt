W - forward
S - Backward
LMB (left mouse button) - attack [It's a small raycast in front of the player, so look at the enemy capsules head on to hit them]

Collect the red bobbing cubes to open doors, if the enemy capsules catch you they take you into the sky, just look at them and attack to save yourself.
